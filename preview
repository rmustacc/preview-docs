# SmartOS Previews

This page serves as a way for folks who are interested in things that
will be coming to SmartOS soon to be able to try them out. These are all
previews, they should not be used in production, there may be bugs, etc.
Without further ado, here's what's currently in progress:

## Overlay gate

I'm currently working on developing overlay networking. In other words,
network virtualization using encapsulation methods such as VXLAN and
NVGRE, while allowing for custom means of looking up the destinations of
machines. This is not yet alpha quality, but development previews are
being created every so often.

For getting started, see [this blog
entry](http://dtrace.org/blogs/rm/illumos/illumos-overlay-networks-development-preview-01/)

## Old work

The following previous preview pieces have since been integrated.

The Bardiche project was integrated on 19 March 2014. See its [project
page](../bardiche/bardiche.html) for more information.

The USB to Fast Ethernet drivers work was integrated in commit
[a16c14a26a4c72468482a0026ecaabafeb24fff9](https://github.com/joyent/illumos-joyent/commit/a16c14a26a4c72468482a0026ecaabafeb24fff9).
SmartOS releases after 05 Mar 2014 should contain this change.

The SIGINFO preview was resolved in commit
[19d32b9ab53d17ac6605971e14c45a5281f8d9bb](https://github.com/joyent/illumos-joyent/commit/19d32b9ab53d17ac6605971e14c45a5281f8d9bb).
